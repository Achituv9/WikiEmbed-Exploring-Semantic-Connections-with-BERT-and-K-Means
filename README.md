The challenge of this project was to evaluate the effectiveness of the BERT model.

We embedded approximately 2.5 million Wikipedia pages and utilized K-means clustering and a Lovain network to assess the quality of the embeddings.

Our analysis successfully revealed meaningful connections between related articles, demonstrating the potential of the embeddings to capture semantic relationships.

the full explain of what we did find in the "Clustering Wikipedia Articles Using BERT and K-Means.pdf" file.
