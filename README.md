The challenge of this project was to evaluate the effectiveness of the BERT model. We embedded approximately 2.5 million Wikipedia pages and utilized K-means clustering and a Lovain network to assess the quality of the embeddings. Our analysis successfully revealed meaningful connections between related articles, demonstrating the potential of the embeddings to capture semantic relationships.
